# Spotify-Clone
"This is a simple yet stylish Spotify Clone built using just HTML and CSS. 
It captures the look and feel of Spotify’s homepage, featuring a sleek dark-themed design, an easy-to-navigate menu, and a visually appealing playlist section. 
The layout is fully responsive, so it looks great on any screen size. 
While it doesn’t stream music, it does a great job of recreating the Spotify vibe, making it a fun project for anyone looking to practice front-end design."
